STEP 3
WHEN A NEW LEAD OR CLIENT
COMES IN — WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

[ A ]  WE FOLLOW UP FAST. EVERY SINGLE TIME.
[ B ]  WE TRY TO. BUT THINGS SLIP THROUGH.
[ C ]  HONESTLY DEPENDS ON HOW BUSY WE ARE.

A → > PIPELINE DISCIPLINE IS RARE IN THIS SPACE. RESPECT.
B → > EVERY MISSED TOUCHPOINT IS REVENUE WALKING OUT THE DOOR.
C → > INCONSISTENCY IS A LEAK. IT COMPOUNDS OVER TIME.


STEP 4
IF A PROSPECT SEARCHED YOUR
NICHE RIGHT NOW —

WOULD THEY FIND YOU BEFORE
THEY FIND YOUR COMPETITOR?

[ A ]  YES. WE HAVE STRONG VISIBILITY.
[ B ]  PROBABLY NOT. WE'RE NOT VERY VISIBLE.
[ C ]  WE RUN ON REFERRALS. ALWAYS HAVE.

A → > GOOD. IS THAT PRESENCE WORKING AS HARD AS IT COULD?
B → > IN A TRUST-BASED INDUSTRY, INVISIBILITY IS EXPENSIVE.
C → > REFERRALS ARE GREAT UNTIL THEY'RE NOT. THEN WHAT?


STEP 5
DOES YOUR BUSINESS HAVE ANY
KIND OF CONTENT PRESENCE —
SOCIAL, VIDEO, THOUGHT LEADERSHIP?

[ A ]  YES. WE POST CONSISTENTLY.
[ B ]  OCCASIONALLY. NOTHING SYSTEMATIC.
[ C ]  NO. WE'VE NEVER PRIORITIZED IT.

A → > GOOD. BUT IS IT ACTUALLY CONVERTING OR JUST EXISTING?
B → > OCCASIONAL IS INVISIBLE. CONSISTENCY IS WHAT COMPOUNDS.
C → > YOUR COMPETITORS ARE BUILDING TRUST WHILE YOU'RE QUIET.


STEP 6
ONE LAST ONE.

IF YOU COULD ELIMINATE ONE
THING FROM YOUR WEEK —
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

[ A ]  CHASING DOCUMENTS AND FOLLOWING UP.
[ B ]  CREATING CONTENT AND MARKETING.
[ C ]  BOTH. HONESTLY BOTH.

A → > THAT'S AN AUTOMATION PROBLEM. FULLY SOLVABLE.
B → > THAT'S A SYSTEMS PROBLEM. FULLY SOLVABLE.
C → > THAT'S EXACTLY WHY AKTIVATE EXISTS.


PATH B — Tech / SaaS / Startup

STEP 2
YOU'RE BUILDING SOMETHING.

HOW ARE YOU CURRENTLY
GETTING IN FRONT OF
THE RIGHT PEOPLE?

[ A ]  CONTENT, ADS, SOCIAL — WE'RE ACTIVE.
[ B ]  MOSTLY WORD OF MOUTH AND OUTBOUND.
[ C ]  HONESTLY WE'RE FIGURING THAT OUT.

A → > ACTIVE IS GOOD. BUT ACTIVE AND EFFECTIVE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS.
B → > WORD OF MOUTH HAS A CEILING. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT?
C → > MOST FOUNDERS ARE. THAT'S NOT A WEAKNESS — YET.


STEP 3
HOW MUCH CONTENT IS YOUR
BRAND ACTUALLY PRODUCING
RIGHT NOW?

[ A ]  A LOT. WE HAVE A REAL SYSTEM.
[ B ]  SOME. BUT IT'S INCONSISTENT.
[ C ]  BARELY ANY. NO TIME, NO PROCESS.

A → > A SYSTEM IS GOOD. IS IT PRODUCING RESULTS OR JUST VOLUME?
B → > INCONSISTENCY MEANS YOUR AUDIENCE FORGETS YOU EXIST.
C → > IN A CROWDED MARKET, SILENCE IS INVISIBLE.


STEP 4
BE HONEST.

DOES YOUR BRAND LOOK DIFFERENT
FROM EVERYONE ELSE IN YOUR SPACE?

[ A ]  YES. WE HAVE A CLEAR POINT OF VIEW.
[ B ]  SORT OF. WE'RE WORKING ON IT.
[ C ]  NOT REALLY. WE LOOK LIKE THE OTHERS.

A → > GOOD. LET'S MAKE SURE IT'S ACTUALLY LANDING.
B → > "SORT OF" IS THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACE TO BE.
C → > THAT'S THE MOST COMMON PROBLEM IN B2B. AND THE MOST FIXABLE.


STEP 5
YOUR INTERNAL OPS —
OUTREACH, FOLLOW-UPS,
CONTENT SCHEDULING, REPORTING.

HOW MUCH OF THAT IS MANUAL?

[ A ]  MOST OF IT IS AUTOMATED.
[ B ]  SOME TOOLS BUT STILL A LOT OF MANUAL WORK.
[ C ]  ALMOST ALL OF IT IS MANUAL.

A → > CLEAN. LET'S SEE IF THERE'S STILL ROOM TO TIGHTEN.
B → > THE GAPS IN PARTIAL AUTOMATION ADD UP FAST.
C → > YOU'RE SPENDING FOUNDER TIME ON THINGS THAT SHOULDN'T NEED YOU.


STEP 6
LAST ONE.

WHAT WOULD CHANGE EVERYTHING
FOR YOUR BUSINESS RIGHT NOW?

[ A ]  MORE VISIBILITY. PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WE EXIST.
[ B ]  BETTER SYSTEMS. WE NEED TO STOP DOING THINGS MANUALLY.
[ C ]  BOTH. WE NEED THE WHOLE THING.

A → > THAT'S A PRESENCE PROBLEM. FULLY SOLVABLE.
B → > THAT'S AN AUTOMATION PROBLEM. FULLY SOLVABLE.
C → > THAT'S EXACTLY WHY AKTIVATE EXISTS.
